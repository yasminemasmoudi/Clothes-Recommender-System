# A Deep Learning based clothes recommender system

The system is designed to recognize different clothing items and provide recommendations based on similarities between them.
It is based on the ResNet50 neural network architecture and uses transfer learning to extract features from the images.
The features are then used to build a Nearest Neighbors model that helps in finding the most similar items.
This project has practical applications in the fashion industry, online shopping, and e-commerce.
